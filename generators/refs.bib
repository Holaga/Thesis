  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

  abstract = 	 {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.   }

Benefits include longer survey durations, improved mission safety, mission repeatability, and reduced operational costs. We review the present status of unmanned vehicles suitable for marine animal monitoring conducted in relation to industrial offshore activities, highlighting which systems are suitable for three main monitoring types: population, mitigation, and focal animal monitoring. We describe the technical requirements for each of these monitoring types and discuss the operational aspects. The selection of a specific sensor/platform combination depends critically on the target species and its behaviour. The technical specifications of unmanned platforms and sensors also need to be selected based on the surrounding conditions of a particular offshore project, such as the area of interest, the survey requirements and operational constraints.}

    abstract = "{Acoustic target classification in multi-frequency echosounder data is a major interest for the marine ecosystem and fishery management since it can potentially estimate the abundance or biomass of the species. A key problem of current methods is the heavy dependence on the manual categorization of data samples. As a solution, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep learning method leveraging a few annotated data samples together with vast amounts of unannotated data samples, all in a single model. Specifically, two inter-connected objectives, namely, a clustering objective and a classification objective, optimize one shared convolutional neural network in an alternating manner. The clustering objective exploits the underlying structure of all data, both annotated and unannotated; the classification objective enforces a certain consistency to given classes using the few annotated data samples. We evaluate our classification method using echosounder data from the sandeel case study in the North Sea. In the semi-supervised setting with only a tenth of the training data annotated, our method achieves 67.6\\% accuracy, outperforming a conventional semi-supervised method by 7.0 percentage points. When applying the proposed method in a fully supervised setup, we achieve 74.7\\% accuracy, surpassing the standard supervised deep learning method by 4.7 percentage points.}",

    abstract = "{Johnsen, E., Pedersen, R., and Ona, E. 2009. Size-dependent frequency response of sandeel schools. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1100–1105. Annual Norwegian sandeel surveys have been conducted in the North Sea since 2005 to measure the stock of lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus). Target identification is often a major challenge in acoustic surveys, and discriminant analyses have been used to separate echoes accurately from schools of herring, mackerel, and sandeel based on their acoustic-frequency responses measured at 18, 38, 120, and 200 kHz. At two fishing grounds during the 2008 survey, 332 schools were identified as sandeel, based on the characteristics of the acoustic signal, and validated by trawl samples. The schools consisted almost entirely of 1-year-old sandeels on one of the grounds, and 2-year-olds on the other. In this study, the potential of acoustic-frequency responses is advanced to classify the sizes of fish in them. A discriminant analysis using frequency responses as independent variables was able to differentiate between sandeel schools comprising 1- and 2-year-old fish (p \\&lt; 0.001). Approximately 83\\% of the 2-year-old fish and 77\\% of the 1-year-old fish were classified correctly. The frequency responses at 18 and 38 kHz were the most important independent variables. Sandeel landings in the North Sea are normally dominated by 1- and 2-year-old sandeels in the first half of the year. This study revealed that these two age classes could be identified acoustically; a finding that may be important for acoustic surveys of sandeels and for management of the commercial sandeel fishery.}",
