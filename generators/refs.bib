abstract = {Written for IT and business professionals, this book provides the technical and business insight needed to plan, deploy and manage the services provided by the Microsoft Azure cloud. Find out how to integrate the infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) models with your existing business infrastructure while maximizing availability, ensuring continuity and safety of your data, and keeping costs to a minimum. The book starts with an introduction to Microsoft Azure and how it differs from Office 365Microsofts other cloud. You'll also get a useful overview of the services available. Part II then takes you through setting up your Azure account, and gets you up-and-running on some of the core Azure services, including creating web sites and virtual machines, and choosing between fully cloud-based and hybrid storage solutions, depending on your needs. Part III now takes an in-depth look at how to integrate Azure with your existing infrastructure. The authors, Anthony Puca, Mike Manning, Brent Rush, Marshall Copeland and Julian Soh, bring their depth of experience in cloud technology and customer support to guide you through the whole process, through each layer of your infrastructure from networking to operations. High availability and disaster recovery are the topics on everyones minds when considering a move to the cloud, and this book provides key insights and step-by-step guidance to help you set up and manage your resources correctly to optimize for these scenarios. Youll also get expert advice on migrating your existing VMs to Azure using InMage, mail-in and the best 3rd party tools available, helping you ensure continuity of service with minimum disruption to the business. In the books final chapters, youll find cutting edge examples of cloud technology in action, from machine learning to business intelligence, for a taste of some exciting ways your business could benefit from your new Microsoft Azure deployment. What youll learn What Microsoft Azure can do (infrastructure and platform as a service), and reasons for adoption How to plan for successful integration of Azure with your existing IT infrastructure How to use the Azure management portal to manage basic workload items, and how to use the enterprise portal for monitoring and reporting How to create web sites on Azure to save platform running and management costs and scale easily How to create virtual machines on Azure and how to migrate them safely from an existing infrastructure When and why to choose different storage options on Azure How to extend your on-premise network to Azure How to handle identity management using Azure Active Directory, from the free edition to the full Enterprise Mobility Suite How to manage your resources with clusters and affinity groups to maximize availability, minimize costs, and optimize disaster recovery scenarios Advanced applications of Azure to machine learning and business intelligence Who this book is for This book is for IT and business administrators and managers looking to deploy some or all of Microsoft Azures services to their existing business infrastructure, while maximizing availability, building robust disaster recovery solutions, and minimizing costs.}

  abstract = 	 {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}

  abstract = 	 {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.   }

abstract = {Recent technology developments have turned present-day unmanned systems into realistic alternatives to traditional marine animal survey methods. Benefits include longer survey durations, improved mission safety, mission repeatability, and reduced operational costs. We review the present status of unmanned vehicles suitable for marine animal monitoring conducted in relation to industrial offshore activities, highlighting which systems are suitable for three main monitoring types: population, mitigation, and focal animal monitoring. We describe the technical requirements for each of these monitoring types and discuss the operational aspects. The selection of a specific sensor/platform combination depends critically on the target species and its behaviour. The technical specifications of unmanned platforms and sensors also need to be selected based on the surrounding conditions of a particular offshore project, such as the area of interest, the survey requirements and operational constraints.}

    abstract = "{Acoustic target classification in multi-frequency echosounder data is a major interest for the marine ecosystem and fishery management since it can potentially estimate the abundance or biomass of the species. A key problem of current methods is the heavy dependence on the manual categorization of data samples. As a solution, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep learning method leveraging a few annotated data samples together with vast amounts of unannotated data samples, all in a single model. Specifically, two inter-connected objectives, namely, a clustering objective and a classification objective, optimize one shared convolutional neural network in an alternating manner. The clustering objective exploits the underlying structure of all data, both annotated and unannotated; the classification objective enforces a certain consistency to given classes using the few annotated data samples. We evaluate our classification method using echosounder data from the sandeel case study in the North Sea. In the semi-supervised setting with only a tenth of the training data annotated, our method achieves 67.6\\% accuracy, outperforming a conventional semi-supervised method by 7.0 percentage points. When applying the proposed method in a fully supervised setup, we achieve 74.7\\% accuracy, surpassing the standard supervised deep learning method by 4.7 percentage points.}",

    abstract = "{Johnsen, E., Pedersen, R., and Ona, E. 2009. Size-dependent frequency response of sandeel schools. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 1100–1105. Annual Norwegian sandeel surveys have been conducted in the North Sea since 2005 to measure the stock of lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus). Target identification is often a major challenge in acoustic surveys, and discriminant analyses have been used to separate echoes accurately from schools of herring, mackerel, and sandeel based on their acoustic-frequency responses measured at 18, 38, 120, and 200 kHz. At two fishing grounds during the 2008 survey, 332 schools were identified as sandeel, based on the characteristics of the acoustic signal, and validated by trawl samples. The schools consisted almost entirely of 1-year-old sandeels on one of the grounds, and 2-year-olds on the other. In this study, the potential of acoustic-frequency responses is advanced to classify the sizes of fish in them. A discriminant analysis using frequency responses as independent variables was able to differentiate between sandeel schools comprising 1- and 2-year-old fish (p \\&lt; 0.001). Approximately 83\% of the 2-year-old fish and 77\% of the 1-year-old fish were classified correctly. The frequency responses at 18 and 38 kHz were the most important independent variables. Sandeel landings in the North Sea are normally dominated by 1- and 2-year-old sandeels in the first half of the year. This study revealed that these two age classes could be identified acoustically; a finding that may be important for acoustic surveys of sandeels and for management of the commercial sandeel fishery.}",

    abstract = "{In 2000, a sandeel fishery off SE Scotland, which commenced in the early 1990s, was closed in response to concerns that the fishery was having a deleterious effect on seabird breeding performance at colonies in the vicinity of the fishing grounds. Fishery-derived catch per unit effort (cpue) data are used together with three different fishery-independent survey techniques (acoustic, demersal trawl, and nocturnal grab survey) to assess variation in sandeel Ammodytes marinus population biomass in the area over the period 1997–2003, a period that included the last three years that the fishery was operating and the first four years of the sandeel fishing moratorium. Temporal trends in estimates of sandeel biomass derived from these different assessment methods were inconsistent and, on the basis of these alone, it was not possible to determine whether sandeel population biomass in the area had increased following the closure of the fishery. The different survey methods assess different components of the sandeel population; acoustic survey and fishery cpue quantified sandeels active in the water column, whilst demersal trawl survey quantified sandeels buried in the sediments. These data were collected at a time of year when sandeels were moving between the seabed sediments and the overlying water column. A grab survey also quantified sandeels buried in the sediment, but these data were collected at a time of year when the entire population should have been buried in the sediment. Differences between the different time-series were reconciled by taking account of the cumulative total primary production in each year prior to the surveys. On the basis of this, a model was developed that utilized acoustic and demersal trawl survey data to estimate the total sandeel population biomass. This model was validated using the nocturnal grab-survey data. The modelled data indicated that the biomass of sandeels 1+ years old increased sharply in the first year of the closure and remained higher in all four of the closure years than in any of the preceding three years, when the fishery was operating. The biomass of 0-group sandeels in three of the four closure years exceeded the biomass present in the three years of commercial fishing. Whereas the response of 1+ sandeels may have been a direct consequence of the closure, this is not likely to have been the case in respect of 0-group sandeels. The closure appears to have coincided with a period of enhanced recruit production.}",

Measurements were made versus incidence angle, −30° to 30° relative to both dorsal and lateral aspect directions, for dead whole sandeel and for excised backbones. Backscatter spectra from whole fish have deep minima at frequencies that vary with fish length and shift to lower frequencies at higher incidence angles. The backscatter spectra from dorsal and lateral aspects differ both in amplitude and in positions of the minima. The backscatter from the excised backbone increases almost linearly with frequency and, below about 150 kHz, contributes only a minor amount to the total sandeel backscatter. A finite element model of sandeel backscatter, developed and compared with the measurements, indicates that shear waves in the backbone contribute little to the overall backscatter from sandeel.}",

We examined spatial and temporal changes in the behaviour and distribution of the lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus by integrating the acoustic ground discrimination system QTC VIEW with a Simrad EK500 fisheries scientific echosounder. QTC VIEW was used to identify acoustic changes in the properties of the seabed in the presence of buried sandeels, whilst the EK500 simultaneously recorded temporal changes in their distribution throughout the water column. Our results suggest that high densities of sandeels buried in sediment give a different acoustic signal to that of its surroundings. This integrated approach showed that sandeels had a diurnal activity pattern that was strongly, although not exclusively, associated with day length. Using this integrated survey method will enable large-scale cost-effective surveys of sandeel behaviour, distribution and abundance to be conducted.}
