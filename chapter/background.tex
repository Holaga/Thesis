\section{Machine Learning} \label{Machine Learning}
    As described in the book Deep Learning\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016_ML} machine learning can intuitively be split into four parts; The algorithm, empirical data, a task and a performance measure. A machine learning algorithm can then be identified as a algorithm that increases its performance on a task, given data. As this happens the algorithm is said to be learning.
    
    \subsection{Algorithm types} \label{Algorithm types}
        The data the algorithm can be given vary and is split into three categories\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016_E}.
