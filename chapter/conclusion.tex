\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
    In this thesis, we have successfully trained acoustic classifiers on pseudo labels with varying subsets of frequencies. We measured the performance of each to give advice on how to equip lightweight, unnamed vessels with echosounders to monitor sandeel.  Based on our results, we conclude that the information gained from the number of frequencies increases drastically from one, up to two, where it afterwards is dependent on the frequencies \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz} to maximize information.
    
    \todo{Based on these simulations we conclude that the relative frequency response has a
greater impact on the modelâ€™s predictions than the shape of the fish schools.}
    
    %This was done by training a series of models with the same architecture on labels produced by an already existing acoustic sandeel classifier, where each model had different subsets of the frequencies available during training.
    
    %We sought the most informative subset of frequencies to be utilized when classifying sandeel in acoustic data. This was done to help identify an optimal choice of frequencies, if the choice of transducers were restricted by for example price or carrying capacity in autonomous vessels. To measure the information lost, we started by producing pseudo labels with an existing automatic acoustic classifier trained to identify sandeel. Then we trained new classifiers based on the same architecture on the same data, but varying subsets of frequencies were used. We could then measure how well these new models could reconstruct the pseudo labels. To find and rank the best performing subset of frequencies, we conducted a greedy search on each subset size used during training. We found that the F1-score increased from a single frequency to two, and then drastically to three, after which only marginal improvements were seen. In particular, the subset containing \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz} achieved close to the same performance as using the complete set of six frequencies. Furthermore, the three frequencies mentioned exhibit unique performance compared to the other subsets of equal size. 

    
    In future research we propose that the tests created in this thesis should be introduced to additional data, and new features. Only the data from 2019 was used as test data during this work, and our results should be verified across years. Once the \gls{crimac} pipeline is compatible with \textit{.zarr} (work of \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic}), it should be tested with the varying frequency subsets, to evaluate their results to ours. Additionally, we propose the implementation of a "depth in water" feature in our model to provide the \gls{cnn} additional context for each crop.
    
    %As the \textit{background} include unknown backscatter, further work should identify if more labels could be drawn from this class and be available to the model. This could give a more exact performance in regard to sandeel, but depends on which labels are produced when the operators generate the data.
    
    - test on real data
    
    
    
    %- more data
    %- actual labels, alter the training scheme of original model
    %- continue training of single frequency classifiers
    %- bias to planktop and other unknown effects, more classes and have fewer uknown things in the ignore / background class.
