\chapter{Results} \label{results}
This chapter will first describe the monitoring and evaluation of the training process. Then a summary of the exhaustive search, followed by the subsets responsible for the highest mean performance per subset size. All individual subsetsâ€™ performances are visualized to find the unique subsets. Finally, the performance trend for each frequency is shown. 

\section{Experiment: Exhaustive Search}
    
    \subsection{Training}
        %In figure \ref{training_overveiw_fig} an example plot illustrates how the training process was monitored. This example is visually tiny, but the most important features will be described in this section. The example comes from the final logging of the model trained on all frequencies.

    Figure \ref{loss_f1_duo_plot_fig} illustrates the metrics measured during the training of a model using a subset of all frequencies. It shows that both the validation and training loss follow the same trend, showing convergence and no issues regarding over-/under-fitting. This is roughly mirrored by the F1-score, as the validation and training F1-scores follows approximately the same values. Finally, the visual inspection suggests satisfactory performance of the classifier on the \textit{sandeel} class, as illustrated in figure \ref{sandeel_threshold_label}.%(add more examples to appendix?)

     Some combinations with one or two frequencies likely needed more training to converge by viewing the complete logs from training. More examples can be found in appendixes \ref{examples training}.
    

\subsection{Results: Exhaustive Search}
    This section starts with a summary of the subsets' mean F1-score from the ten experiments. They were summarized per subset size and show minimum F1-score, maximum F1-score, and median F1-score in table \ref{summary_per_subset_size_table}. The minimum and median scores increase with the subset size, but the max performance stagnates after a subset size of three is reached. The mean F1-score of all individual subsets can be viewed in appendix \ref{result_all_subsets_table}.

Figure \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig} illustrate the exact frequencies contributing to the max mean F1-score for each subset size. The F1-score increases up to three frequencies, but then stagnates in performance.

    The exact frequencies contributing to the max performing subsets are visualized for precision in figure \ref{increasing_freq_precision_score_fig}. It follows the same trend as seen in figure \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig} for F1-score.

    The exact frequencies contributing to the max performing subsets are visualized for recall in figure \ref{increasing_freq_recall_score_fig}. It reaches high values of recall at a subsets size of two, which faster than both F1-score and recall. Recall is also always higher than precision for all subsets sizes, showing that recall plays the most significant role in the F1-score.

    \subsection{Individual Subsets}
        Figure \ref{errorbar_fig} illustrates a complete plot of all error bars, with sections for each subset size. A red circle encompassing the error bar related to the subset containing only \textit{18},\textit{38} and \textit{200kHz}. This combination outclasses all other subsets in the same and previous subset sizes and competes with all the results later achieved by larger subsets. In all other sections, no subset stands out regarding F1-score.

            \caption[Error bars per combination]{Each colored error bar represents a frequency subset. The error bars color in this figure are purely meant to distinguish the error bars from each other. The error bar's highest y-value is the max value achieved for this subset from all ten tests, and the bottom is the lowest. Blue vertical lines group the error bars by the size of the subset and the black dots are the mean performance of the subset. A red ring encompasses the subsets 18kHz, 38kHz, and 200kHz.}

        To further analyze the performance of the unique subset \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz}, two new subsets of results were created. The first with subsets that, at a minimum, contained the aforementioned frequencies. These subsets were then removed from the initial results, and then the eight best performing from this set were extracted. Both of these subsets are visualized in figure \ref{with_without_figure} and show that all the highest performing subsets include the frequencies \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz}.

    \subsection{Performance Trend per Frequency}
        In this section, the performance trend for each frequency is visualized. For each frequency, all subsets it was part of were extracted and then sorted in increasing order of mean F1-score, and visualized in figure \ref{performance_trend_fig}.

            \caption[Performance trend per frequency]{This figure illustrates the performance trend of each frequency. From right to left, the plot shows that \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz} all are part of many combinations with high F1-scores, as seen earlier in figure \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig}. The remaining frequencies quickly fall in performance, most likely due to not being paired with the three previously mentioned. Looking further to the left, \textit{18kHz} seems to have participated in many combinations on average, resulting in high F1-scores, followed closely by \textit{200kHz}.}
