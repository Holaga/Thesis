\section{Result Exhaustive Search}
    
    \subsection{Training}
        In figure \ref{training_overveiw_fig} an example plot in illustrated of how the training process was monitored. This example is small, but the most important features will now be described. The example comes from the final logging of the model trained on all frequencies.

        Extracted from figure \ref{training_overveiw_fig} figure \ref{loss_f1_duo_plot_fig} illustrates both validation and the training follows the same values and convergence trend. The F1-score for validation and training data follows the same approximately same values, showing no issues regarding over-/under-fitting. Finally, the sanity check visualize good performance on correctly identifying \textit{sandeel} class as illustrated in figure \ref{sandeel_threshold_label}.%(add more examples to appendix?)

    These results also show that a model can successfully be trained on pseudo labels. The logs from training showed that some combinations with low amounts of frequencies would need more training to converge. More examples on logged output can be found in the appendixes, as there are too many to efficiently illustrate here.  (LEGG IN DETTE). 
    
    \subsection{Performance Metrics - Greedy Search}
        In figure \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig} the best frequency combinations based on F1-score is visualized. \textit{200kHz} dominates the results, and stays in all combinations. The most drastic increase in performance happens with the 3 frequencies \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz} and \textit{200kHz} being used.

        In figure \ref{increasing_freq_precision_score_fig} the best frequencies combinations based on precision is visualized. The trend is similar to the one based on F1-score.

        In figure \ref{increasing_freq_recall_score_fig} the best frequencies combinations based on precision is visualized. The steep increase in performance happens already at two frequencies. Indicating that the best combination at this stage already finds most of the \textit{sandeel} class.

    \subsection{All Combinations}
        Figure \ref{errorbar_fig} illustrate a complete plot of all error bars, with sections for each test. The plot has no complete overview over what frequencies belong to what result, but only a red circle encompassing the error bar related to the combination \textit{18},\textit{38} and \textit{200kHz}. This combination outclasses all other combinations in the same and previous tests, as well as competes with all the results later achieved. In all other sections, no combinations stands out as the unique regarding F1-score.

    \subsection{Performance Trend Per Frequency} 
        Figure \ref{performance_trend_fig} illustrates the performance trend of each frequency. From right to left, the plot shows to that \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz} and \textit{200kHz} all are part of many combinations with high F1-scores. The rest quickly fall in performance, most likely due to not being paired with any of the three previously mentioned. Looking further to the left, \textit{18kHz} seems to have participated in many combinations on average, resulting in high F1-scores. Followed closely by \textit{200kHz}.
