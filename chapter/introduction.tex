\section{Marine Advisory Work}
    The \gls{ices} is an intergovernmental science organization that is the primary provider of advice on marine ecosystems to the governments and international bodies that manage the North Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas\cite{ICES2020}. It consists of over 6000 marine scientists, over 300 institutes, and 20 member countries, including Norway. Advice is developed by expert groups who work towards a better understanding of marine ecosystems and their sustainable use. The \gls{imr} is a significant  contributor, and one of its activities is to give input to these advices through research and monitoring. An important research area is the monitoring of a species known as the \textit{lesser sandeel}, which is the area to which this thesis seeks to contribute.
    
\section{Why the Lesser Sandeel?}
    The lesser sandeel (\textit{Ammodytes marinus}), from now on just \textit{sandeel}, is
    a small pelagic \footnote{Pelagic fish inhabit in the pelagic zone of ocean or lake waters – living neither close to the bottom nor near the shore.} fish that resides in sandy-bottomed coastal and shallow ocean waters and feeds mainly on plankton. It plays a key role in the North Sea, as it has a major function in the marine ecosystem as forage fish\footnote{Forage fish are small pelagic fish which are preyed on by larger predators.} and as the catch for fisheries. Due to the high level of predation, it lives large parts of its life buried in a sandy seabed, but during the spring feeding season, adults emerge each dawn to create large schools in the upper pelagic layer. Historical data show that changes in their abundance cause bottom-up effects of the ecosystem, causing, for example, breeding failure among several species of seabird \cite{johnsen2017collective}. 
    
    The North Sea is under pressure from various factors, including fishing, coastal construction, maritime transport, oil and gas exploration and production, tourism and recreation, navigation dredging, aggregate\footnote{Raw materials such as gravel, crushed stone, or sand that are obtained from natural sources.} extraction, military activities, and wind farm construction \cite{ICES2021}. Because of the importance of sandeel, \gls{imr} has conducted annual acoustic trawl missions since 2005 in sandeel areas of the North Sea\cite{johnsen2017collective}. The goal is to monitor the sandeel stock and create input and data to help the \gls{ices} make scientifically-backed advice, one of which is recommendations for fishing quotas\cite{sizedependentfreqrespons2009johnsen}.

\section{IMRs Acoustic Trawl Surveys}
    When fisheries conduct acoustic surveys of fish, they use \textit{echo sounders} to detect and observe targets in the water remotely. Echo sounders are a special variety of \textit{sonar}, where the acoustic beam produced by a \textit{transducer} is directed vertically downwards from the measuring platform at a set frequency\cite{simmonds2008fisheries}. \gls{imr}s acoustic trawl surveys combine acoustic data from echo sounders, and biological data from trawl catches. The echo sounders in use by the \gls{imr} usually capture acoustic data at multiple frequencies in parallel to maximize the information acquired\cite{korneliussen2018acoustic}. The scrutiny of the data is done through the use of a post-processing software called \gls{lsss}, where \textit{acoustic target classification} is done \textit{manually} with the biological samples as aid\cite{korneliussen2006large}. Afterwards, the output \gls{lsss}-data and biological samples are further processed to estimate the fish abundance and age distribution to support \gls{ices} advice\cite{johnsen2019stox}. 

    %Afterwards, the output \gls{lsss}-data and biological samples are input to a software called StoX.  This is an open-source software which is used to estimate the fish abundance and age distribution to be further used as support for \gls{ices} advice\cite{johnsen2019stox}. 
    
    %The echogram for each frequency channel used is stored as a 2-dimensional picture, where each pixel value is a \gls{sv} value.

    
 %Some fish species could not be distinguished from the sprat in the acoustic signal, and more echosounders could have given additional information about the species present\cite{korneliussen2008proposals}. 
        
        %Larger research vessels create a layer of noise consisting of turbulence and bubbles in the water, which can be detrimental to the performance of the echosounder\cite{korneliussen2008proposals}. Hence, the transducers are usually mounted on retractable keels to get below this layer, and as a consequence, vessels usually applied in this context have an 8-meter acoustic  blind zone. The kayak produces significantly less noise in the water, and the retractable keel was only 1.5 meters, and results showed that the vessel managed to measure fish that usually live closer to the surface. In addition, the kayak is less prone to scare away the fish. The lightweight kayak platform enabled it to collect data from shallower water, inaccessible to the larger vessels. However, 

\section{Acoustic Classification of Sandeel} \label{acoustic classification sandeel}

    Acoustic target classification is a major challenge in most acoustic surveys, and the sandeel is known to be difficult to interpret\cite{sizedependentfreqrespons2009johnsen,johnsen2017collective}.  The earlier mentioned Norwegian sandeel surveys use the \textit{200kHz} frequency to delineate schools, while the \textit{18kHz} and \textit{38kHz} are the most important frequencies for classification when measurements were taken at \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, \textit{120kHz}, and \textit{200kHz}\cite{sizedependentfreqrespons2009johnsen}. Some earlier works have had trouble identifying sandeel at \textit{38kHz} and \textit{120kHz}\cite{hassel2004influence,mackinson2005using,mosteiro2004dual}, while some have had success using combinations of the four frequencies \textit{18kHz, 38kHz, 120kHz, and 200kHz} to specifically separate sandeel from herring and mackerel\cite{mohammed2006acoustic}. 

    %It has been shown that large schools of sandeel likely have a connection to the seabed, resulting in severe underestimates of such schools by conventional echosounders\cite{johnsen2017collective}.

    \citet{brautaset2020acoustic} successfully applied deep learning methods to automatically classify sandeel in multi-frequency  acoustic data from the Norwegian sandeel surveys. They extracted and utilized the four frequencies \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, \textit{120kHz}, and \textit{200kHz} from the original data, but a problem within deep learning is that feature importance can be difficult to interpret. Hence, it is hard to establish precisely what frequencies contributed the most to their results.
    
    %The objective of this thesis is to create scientific advice for   which echo sounders to be installed on lightweight unmanned vessels, with the goal to classify sandeel in the acoustic data. As mentioned in the previous section, they may have reduced carrying capacity for echo sounders, and the choice of which to install to maximize the information collected is essential. To achieve this, we will expand upon the work of \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic} and measure the information stored in all possible subsets of the frequencies contained in the original data from the Norwegian sandeel surveys in the year 2018 and 2019: \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, \textit{70kHz}, \textit{120kHz}, \textit{200kHz}, and \textit{333kHz}.

    %Which frequency/frequencies should be used when classifying sandeel in acoustic data, especially if a lightweight vessel, which can only carry a subset of echosounders used during the Norwegian sandeel surveys, are to be equipped to solve the same task? Recently, \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic} applied deep learning methods to successfully classify sandeel in acoustic data from these surveys. With this work as a basis, we will investigate the six frequencies \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, \textit{120kHz}, \textit{70kHz}, \textit{200kHz}, and \textit{333kHz}, to find which subsets of these are the most informative when classifying sandeel.
%\subsection{Noise}
    %Noise in acoustic data are split into two categories, either \textit{unwanted  targets} produced by the echosounder or signals already present in the medium. The first is defined by the \textit{goal} behind the observation. If we want to observe fish, then plankton is unwanted and vice versa. The latter source of noise originates from either physical (wind, waves...), biological (animals sounds...), or artificial (noise generated by the vessel). By using noise-filtering and

   %Echograms represent some visible observation of the water column below the echosounder, and measuring the backscatter of several frequencies channels in parallel, each frequency channel can be viewed as similar to color channels in a picture\cite{brautaset2020acoustic}. Hence, machine learning techniques usually applied to image data are also applicable to \textit{echograms}. Figure \ref{accoustic data and color channels fig} illustrates an example of this:

    %This section describes the data gathered by the Simrad EK60 echosounder system produced during the yearly acoustic trawl surveys conducted by the \gls{imr}\cite{johnsen2017collective} and how it relates to image data. Echosounders are maritime instruments, in this case mounted below a ship, which emit acoustic waves into the water (\textit{ping}) and log the backscattered waves\cite{brautaset2020acoustic}. The logs record the \gls{sv}. The data is 2-dimensional, recording the \textit{date and time of the ping} and \textit{range} (\textit{depth}) of the backscattered waves, for each frequency channel used during the measurement. This output is called an \textit{echogram}. As the ping rate was set to 1Hz\cite{choi2021semi}, with a pulse duration of 1.024 milliseconds, the length of each pixel is 1 second horizontally and 19.2 centimeters vertically. These echograms represent some visible observation of the water column below the echosounder, and because of this, each frequency channel can be viewed as similar to color channels in a picture.

This is because it has mainly focused on tasks we humans do seemingly without training, while computers struggle with it. Examples are facial recognition and object detection in video and image data. There are also works that have gone beyond human capability, like \citeauthor{davis2014visual_deep_video_audio}s\cite{davis2014visual_deep_video_audio} work, where they recovered sounds from the vibrations they induced in objects captured on video. 
    
\section{Unmanned Vehicles in Marine Science} \label{Unmanned Vehicles in Marine Science}
        In \citeyear{VERFUSS201917} \citeauthor{VERFUSS201917}\cite{VERFUSS201917} reviewed the current status of unmanned vehicles suitable for monitoring marine life. The different types of vehicles can operate stationary or moving, on the ocean surface, as aerial or submerged.  They can either be remotely controlled, autonomous, or a combination of both. They can use a wide array of sensors, but in the case of acoustic sensors, \citeauthor{VERFUSS201917} emphasized the need to efficiently assign the correct species to the measured animal. This directly impacts the technical requirements of the vehicles purchased, as they need a minimum amount of information provided by the sensors to solve the given task. For example, the number of transducers installed can quickly become a weight problem as the weight of a transducer drastically increases at lower frequencies\footnote{Two sample transducers sold by Kongsberg Maritime for fisheries at the frequencies 18kHz and 333kHz weigh respectively 85kg and 2kg \cite{kongsberg_transducers}.}.  Many of the vessels reviewed are commercially available, which has led to a growth in number and use.  The increase in unmanned vehicles and the possibility of gathering more complex data will lead to an exponential rise in the data collected in marine science\cite{malde2020machine}. This further increases the need to make automated programs, or better tools to aid in the current manual data processing, which today is a major chokepoint. Furthermore, the nature of the data gathered will change, possibly in decreasing quality, as humans will have fewer or no opportunities to actively engage in the autonomous information gathering processes.
        %Possibly, further increasing the need for more support vessels and personnel with expertise system knowledge.
        
        During the summer of \citeyear{johnsen2020measuring}, an unmanned vessel was tested in Årdalsfjorden in Norway and involved a kayak with an electric motor, and one 200kHz echosounder was installed to measure \textit{sprat} abundance. Earlier surveys had indicated that large numbers of sprat lives close to the surface, in which the traditional research vessels have an acoustic blind zone\footnote{Echosounder are usually mounted on the bottom of the vessel, creating a blind zone up to the surface. Often on a retractable keel to get underneath a layer of bubbles that can be detrimental to the echosounders performance \cite{korneliussen2008proposals}.}. The kayak survey showed that the small vessel managed to measure high densities of sprat in the blind zone. It were also less prone to scare away the fish as the kayak produced significantly less noise, and its size allowed access to shallower waters. The end result was positive for the continued use of unmanned vessels, but the manned vessels are still needed for biological samples\cite{johnsen2020measuring}.
        


\section{Research Question}

As mentioned, they may have reduced carrying capacity or other limitations for echo sounders, and the choice of which to install to maximize the information collected is essential.
