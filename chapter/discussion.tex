\chapter{Discussion}
    %This section covers the key findings from the results and their implications..
    
    In this thesis, an approach to find the subset of frequencies most applicable to classify sandeel in acoustic data has been implemented to advice on how to equip smaller unmanned vessels. The results in figure  \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig} illustrate the best performing combination of frequencies per subset size and would act as advice for vessels that are to be equipped  with a subset of echo sounders using the frequencies tested. After the subset size of three, the performance does not increase significantly for larger subsets in F1-score. Recall is the most significant part of the F1-score, which implies that finding instances of possible sandeel in the data requires fewer frequencies than accurately classifying it, which is to be expected as the latter is likely a more complex task and requires additional information. 
    
    % This was done by training a series of models with the same architecture on labels produced by an already existing acoustic sandeel classifier, where each model had different subsets of the frequencies available during training.
    
    
    %The figures \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig} (F1-score), \ref{increasing_freq_precision_score_fig} (precision), \ref{increasing_freq_recall_score_fig} (recall) can all be used to select frequencies for surveys depending on the nature of the task.


    The unique performance of the subset containing \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz}, depicted in figure \ref{errorbar_fig}, supports the current methods applied by the \gls{imr} described in section \ref{acoustic classification sandeel}, where the same frequencies are important for the classifications (\textit{18kHz} and \textit{38kHz}) and delineation (\textit{200kHz}) of sandeel schools. However, our results cannot tell \textit{how} and in \textit{what magnitude} each of the frequencies contributes to the classification process for this subset, a clear possibility for future work. The \textit{200kHz} channel is present in all subsets in figure \ref{increasing_freq_f1_score_fig}, and for the subsets size of two, the \textit{70kHz}  is chosen over both \textit{18kHz} and \textit{38kHz} (\textit{although with a small margin to the other subsets as described in appendix \ref{test_per_freq_f1_appendix}}). This suggests that there is synergy between the two latter frequencies. Furthermore, figure \ref{with_without_figure} shows that the unique subset of three is part of all the highest performing subsets, and a sharp drop in performance can be seen if they are not all present in a subset. This leads to the proposition that vessels equipped with three or more echo sounders should include \textit{18kHz}, \textit{38kHz}, and \textit{200kHz} as a minimum. 

    There is likely some bias toward the frequencies used in the basis work, as the features our additional two frequencies (\textit{70kHz and 333kHz}) may have contained, which were not included in \citet{brautaset2020acoustic}, played no part in forming the labels.  However, by viewing figure \ref{performance_trend_fig}, \textit{120kHz} can be interpreted as a frequency present in a high number of low-performing subsets. The performance trend was almost as good as 70kHz but worse than \textit{333kHz}. This suggests that the information found in \textit{120kHz} may also be found in \textit{70kHz} and \textit{333kHz}. In addition, we suggest that further work could look into removing the 120kHz frequency, rerun the experiments of \citet{brautaset2020acoustic}, and observe the change in performance. 
    %All our best subsets after, and including, three frequencies, compares to the performance they achieved on all but two years (\textit{2009 and 2018}). ---- 
    %This may be valid for the unique subset of three frequencies mentioned in the paragraph above.
    
    %The choice of using the output from \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic} model as pseudo labels likely made our model inherit the same strengths and weaknesses of their model. The performance of the work in this thesis would likely never surpass, just approach that of the model from \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic}. Furthermore, generalizability was likely reduced by the amount of data used during our experiments and was restricted because of little computational power. In the works of \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic}, they utilized a total of 12 years, while our work only used data from two years (2018 and 2019). On entire echograms, their highest F1-score was 0.78 in 2018 (\textit{our test dataset}), and our best subsets resulted in a mean performance of 0.67.
    
    The objective of this task was not to train a better model, but assess which frequencies explain the performance achieved by the state-of-the-art model created by \citet{brautaset2020acoustic}. This use of pseudo labels were justified by the solid performance shown by the baseline  model, but would mean that our models would likely never surpass, just approach their performance. As models produced in this work have shown performance close to \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic}, the results were judged to be adequate to formulate advice for the maximally informative subset of frequencies. Future work should investigate the change in the results if the threshold of 0.8 applied to create the hard mask for the pseudo labels was altered. Additionally, changes should be made to allocate all pixels to the background class which were not assigned to the sandeel or other classes after the threshold. This would likely not change the results, as most pixels were allocated to a class.
    
    %Furthermore, the goal of this task was to find the best performing subsets of frequencies relative to the other subsets, not so much the \textit{true} performance of the subset when classifying sandeel.
    
    % The operator annotations belonging to the acoustic data were unavailable during this thesis; thus, the solution became the pseudo labels. This was justified by the solid performance shown by the model produced by \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic}, but would mean that our models would likely never surpass, just approach their performance.

    The performance achieved by the models in this work showed that some of our models could generalize from 2019 to 2018 on a much smaller training dataset than used in \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic}. The results from \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic} may indicate that the quality of the data itself increased in the more recent years. As the data quality is crucial for the model, this may indicate that acoustic classifiers can be successfully trained using far fewer quantities of high-quality data. This assumes that the data contained in the 2019 dataset is high-quality, which is hard for us to evaluate. Meanwhile, more data will likely make the classifier more robust to noise. Future work should retrain and test our model on the same years and amounts of data described in \citeauthor{brautaset2020acoustic} to establish a better comparison.  
    
    Additionally, information about the range from the transducer in the crops evaluated by the model would likely increase performance. As acoustic backscattering from the same object can change with distance, giving the model additional context to better handle this complexity. Range should be evaluated as a feature to include in future work.
