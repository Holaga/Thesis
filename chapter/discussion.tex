    \section{things}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item data, probability scheme
            \item hyperparameters for my work
            \item problems introduces by pseudo labels and 
            \item .zarr issue, not .mmemap? Utilize crimac pipeline
            \item thresholding, sometimes all classes are 0, different threshold? Based og Brautaset
            \item model biased towards brautseth frequencies??
            \item folder structure instead of regions??
            \item regrid, possible errors in the preprocessor 
            \item supervised/ semi - supervised? 
            \item other options for training, early stopping...
            \item Lightweigth vessel, no operator annotations from trawl cathes. Viability?
            \item No imputation of the missing values, as I only focused on the values above the seafloor.
            \item proportional increase/decrease in performance for each frequency combination 
            \item residual connections??? \cite{zhang2018road}
            \item plankton, top layer, false positive
            \item Semi-supervised target classification in multi-frequency
echosounder data - we assign the SE or OT class to the patch, where the num-
ber of corresponding fish pixels is greater than or equal to 16 pixels
which occupy 1.56% of the pixels in the patch. On the other hand,
the patch without fish-annotated pixels is annotated to the BG class.

    \section{Further work}
        - Apply the model to more data, to verify its generalization performance.
