    \section{things}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item data, probability scheme
            \item hyperparameters for my work
            \item problems introduces by pseudo labels and 
            \item .zarr issue, not .mmemap? Utilize crimac pipeline
            \item thresholding, sometimes all classes are 0, different threshold? Based og Brautaset
            \item model biased towards brautseth frequencies??
            \item folder structure instead of regions??
            \item regrid, possible errors in the preprocessor 
            \item supervised/ semi - supervised? 
            \item other options for training, early stopping...
            \item Lightweigth vessel, no operator annotations from trawl cathes. Viability?
            \item No imputation of the missing values, as I only focused on the values above the seafloor.
            \item proportional increase/decrease in performance for each frequency combination 
            \item residual connections??? \cite{zhang2018road}
            \item plankton, top layer, false positive
        \end{itemize}
