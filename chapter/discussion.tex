        \begin{itemize}
            \item data, probability scheme
            \item hyperparameters for my work
            \item problems introduces by pseudo labels and 
            \item .zarr issue, not .mmemap? Utilize crimac pipeline
            \item thresholding, sometimes all classes are 0
            \item model biased towards brautseth frequencies??
            \item folder structure instead of regions??
            \item regrid, possible errors in the preprocessor 
            \item supervised/ semi - supervised? 
            \item other options for training, early stopping...
            \item Lightweigth vessel, no operator annotations from trawl cathes. Viability?
